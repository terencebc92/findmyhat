# Find my hat - JavaScript assessment

## What did you like about this project?
This assignment challenged my understanding of JavaScript and I had to apply several concepts such as classes, 2D arrays, while loops, control flow, functions, variables and booleans. I enjoyed breaking down the task into smaller sub-tasks and to try to think of the mechanics of the game before writing the code.

## What did you struggle with in this project?
I knew what functions needed to be built individually but I struggled with placing them in a meaningful order to form the entire game. So there was a bit of trial and error on my part to see which part fits where.

## What would make your experience with this assessment better?
At first, I started by writing several functions, but I didn't understand how to integrate them. One of the ways I realized was to use a class object hence I think a better understanding of class objects would have helped me complete this assessment in less time.
